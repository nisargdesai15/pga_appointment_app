# pga_appointment_app

Take Home Project - Engineering
The purpose of this exercise is to provide candidates for engineering roles the opportunity to demonstrate their software development skills through a small programming project.

In order to respect your time, we ask that you please timebox this exercise up to 4 hours. Full implementation of all functional requirements outlined by the exercise is not mandatory if the allotted time does not allow for it.
Case Overview
Create a daily appointment scheduling application for your local PGA professional to replace their paper sign-up sheet for golf lessons. The instructor offers 30-minute swing analysis sessions every half hour between 8:00AM - 4:00PM. To keep things simple, assume the instructor begins each day with an open schedule and only allows for same-day bookings.



Your application should support the following scope of functional requirements:
Display available appointment times for the current day.
Book a time slot for a student
Display booked sessions
Cancel a booking
